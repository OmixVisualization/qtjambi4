    \title Qt Jambi System Properties Reference

    Qt Jambi provides a few system properties. Notably, the
    properties can be used to specify locations of native resources,
    e.g., libraries and Qt plugins. We present the properties in the
    table below.

    You specify a system property on the command line to the Java VM
    with the \c{-D} option. For instance:

    \code
        java -Dcom.trolltech.qt.verbose-loading=true -jar qtjambi.jar
    \endcode

    \table 75%
        \header
            \o Property
            \o Description
        \row
            \o com.trolltech.qt.verbose-loading
            \o When this property is true, Qt Jambi will report on
               all attempts to load native libraries.
        \row
            \o com.trolltech.qt.debug
            \o When this property is set to true, the Qt debug libraries
               will be used. This is necessary if Qt was built with
               debugging turned on.
        \row
            \o com.trolltech.qt.library-path-override
            \o This property can be used to set paths to where Qt Jambi will1
               search for native libraries.
        \row
            \o com.trolltech.qt.exclude-libraries
            \o If you start a Qt Jambi application from an already
               running VM, you do not want to reload the native
               libraries. In this property, you can separate library
               names that are not to be loaded with the system path
               separator.
        \row 
            \o com.trolltech.qt.exceptions-for-messages
 	    \o Installs a default QMessageHandler that produces exceptions when
	    would normally issue a warning. This can be helpful for debuggin.
